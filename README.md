### Python 

#### Overview On Day 2, I'll create a simple calculator using Python. This calculator will handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

#### Instructions 
 1. **Setup:**
    - Create a Python script file for your calculator.
 2. **Python Functions:**
    - **`addNum(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.**
    - `subNum(a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
    - `mulNum(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
    - `divideNum(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, with a check for division by zero.
