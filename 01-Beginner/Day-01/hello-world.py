# Day 1 of 45 Days Challenge of writing code

"""
Introduction: 
This project is the very first step in your 45-day coding challenge. The "Hello, World!" program is a simple yet significant milestone for any programmer. 
It is often the first program written when learning a new programming language because it provides a basic introduction to the syntax and structure of the language. 
In this project, I will create a "Hello, World!" program in Python. This will help me get familiar with the development environment and basic syntax of Python.
